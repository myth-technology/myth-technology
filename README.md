### ðŸ§­ Mission
We build practical AI systems that ship: **robust agents, reliable evaluation, and efficient inference**.  
Our open-source work focuses on **developer experience** and **operational reliability** so teams can go from idea â†’ prototype â†’ production with confidence.

---

### ðŸ”® What weâ€™re working on
- **myth/agent-kit** â€“ Composable agent runtime (tools, memory, routing) with predictable behavior.
- **myth/eval** â€“ Task-driven evaluation: datasets, metrics, judges, and report cards.
- **myth/serve** â€“ Minimal, fast inference gateway with caching, cost tracking, and fallbacks.
- **myth/prompt** â€“ Typed prompt pipelines, versioning, and sandboxed tests.
- **myth/datasets** â€“ Curated, reproducible corpora for agent/eval workflows.

> Tip: Pin your top 6 repos on the org to mirror the list above.
